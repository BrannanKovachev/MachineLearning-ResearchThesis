Honors College Research thesis regarding Feature Selection and Rule Extraction in Machine Learning Algorithms

I investigated various methods for feature selection and rule extraction in classsification models. We used a dataset of HPTLC images wich contain 5 species of licorice. Our goal is not only to train a classifier but also generate a simple set of rules using a few features.

Thesis will be complete by May 2023
